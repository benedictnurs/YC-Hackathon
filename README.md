We use [Moss](https://www.usemoss.dev/) (Sematic search), [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) (State for agents), [AgentMail](https://agentmail.to/) (Email updates), [Mastra](https://mastra.ai) (Agents), [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) (Email generation), [Replit](https://replit.com/) (Frontend)

This is our [submission]([https://agentmail.to/](https://shipyardhq.tech/projects/9ddcb5bc-5ac8-4177-bf08-ed6a8114be8c)) for [AgentMail](https://agentmail.to/)'s [HackHalloween](https://events.ycombinator.com/agentmail-yc25) event.

## Design

General system design

## Components

#### 1. Frontend - Command and Control

Uses Replit and React JS. Used to configure and start your agents.

#### 2. Backend - Agent Manager

Written in Python using FastAPI to start agents when requested from the frontend. Also responsible for running the Email Summary Service.

[Backend Docs](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/YC-Hackathon-Oct-2025/tree/main/backend).

**POST** `/start-agent`

Starts an agent with the provided configuration.

## Request Body

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `email` | string | Yes | Valid email address |
| `hosted_api_url` | string | Yes | URL of the hosted API |
| `github_repo` | string | Yes | GitHub repository URL |

#### 3. Email Summary Service

Send an email summary with Agent Mail.

##### Email on startup

##### Email when agent is done

#### 4. The Agents

We will use [Mastra](https://mastra.ai) to write our agents. They will use [Moss](https://www.usemoss.dev/), Convex, and Hyperspell for their searching and memory.

They will use the provided API url and look for a openapi.json to know what routes to call. It can remember this with Hyperspell.

The semantic search with the source aware GitHub pulling. If we want to test an endpoint called "/test", we can use either Moss or Convex to pull up the relevant code to augment our result.

The agent can pull unprocessed agent start requests

When there are no unprocessed:

Final Results:

It then saves that to the database:

Finnaly, it sends us an email!

#### Engineering Notes
- Max of 500 .py files in Moss agent for now, can be scaled later but kept at a respectable size right now to minimize system latency.

##### Why use Convex?
- Uses a queue system to keep agent state
- Our Mastra agents are in typescript and backend is in python. We would already need a HTTP server anyways, might as well use Convx as a queue for fast data retrieval.
- We can use Reactive Queries where the Agents can subscribe to queue changes in real-time
